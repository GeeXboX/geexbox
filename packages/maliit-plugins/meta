PKG_SHORTDESC="Maliit Keyboard - An on screen keyboard for mobile devices."
PKG_LONGDESC="This plugin is provided by the Maliit project in the maliit-plugins repository. 
It is the default keyboard plugin, implemented in Qt/C++, using Qt Graphics for its renderer. 
It is carefully split up into components to keep the core free of QtGui/QtWidget, to allow 
easy porting to Qt 5 and to allow a QML renderer on top.

It has replaced the MeeGo Keyboard, which is still used on the Nokia N9."
