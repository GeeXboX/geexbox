PKG_LONG_DESC="This library is to encapsulate CD-ROM reading and control. Applications wishing to be oblivious of the OS- and device-dependant properties of a CD-ROM can use this library. Some support for disk image types like BIN/CUE and NRG is available, so applications that use this library also have the ability to read disc images as though they were CD's."
