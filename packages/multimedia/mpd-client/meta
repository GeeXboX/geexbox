PKG_LONGDESC="Music Player Client (MPC) is a client that allows remote access for playing audio files (Ogg-Vorbis, FLAC, MP3, Wave, and AIFF), streams (Ogg-Vorbis, MP3) and managing playlists.  Gapless playback, buffered output, and crossfading support is also included.  The design focus is on integrating a computer into a stereo system that provides control for music playback over a TCP/IP network.  The goals are to be easy to install and use, to have minimal resource requirements (it has been reported to run fine on a Pentium 75), and to remain stable and flexible."
