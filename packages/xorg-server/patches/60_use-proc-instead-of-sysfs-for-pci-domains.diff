/* Upstream commit 56f21bda1ce95741c88c423b60bd709eef26eb12 was supposed to
 * only avoid multiple scans of the PCI devices, but it actually also added
 * an "optimization" based on using sysfs files instead of /proc. However,
 * this code is broken, for instance because there are no ioctl handler on
 * /sys/bus/pci/devices/*/config files while there some on /proc/bus/pci/*
 *
 * It breaks the Xserver on architectures that require such ioctls to scan
 * the PCI devices and/or deal with PCI domains:
 * #422077: xserver-xorg: Fatal server error on sparc: xf86MapPciMem failed
 * #422095: xserver-xorg-core: fails to start on powerpc, no devices detected
 *
 * The following patch forces the server to behave as if we were running on
 * a 2.4 kernel while scanning PCI devices, so that the sysfs code is disabled.
 * 
 * Upstream doesn't apply this patch since they want to fix the sysfs-code.
 * See https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7248
 *
 * Thanks to Jim Watson for testing!
