PKG_LONGDESC="lxml is a new Python binding for libxml2 and libxslt, completely independent from existing Python bindings. lxml aims to provide a Pythonic API by following as much as possible the ElementTree API, trying to avoid inventing too many new APIs, or the user's having to learn new things -- XML is complicated enough."
