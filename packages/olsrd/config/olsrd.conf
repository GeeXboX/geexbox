# Specifies how much neighbor info should

# Olsrd plugins to load
# This must be the absolute path to the file
# or the loader will use the following scheme:
# - Try the paths in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH
#   environment variable.
# - The list of libraries cached in /etc/ld.so.cache
# - /lib, followed by /usr/lib

# Example plugin entry with parameters:

#LoadPlugin "olsrd_dyn_gw.so.0.3"
#{
    # Here parameters are set to be sent to the
    # plugin. Theese are on the form "key" "value".
    # Parameters ofcause, differs from plugin to plugin.
    # Consult the documentation of your plugin for details.

    # Example: dyn_gw params

    # how often to check for Internet connectivity
    # defaults to 5 secs
#   PlParam     "Interval"   "40"

    # if one or more IPv4 addresses are given, do a ping on these in
    # descending order to validate that there is not only an entry in
    # routing table, but also a real internet connection. If any of
    # these addresses could be pinged successfully, the test was
    # succesful, i.e. if the ping on the 1st address was successful,the
    # 2nd won't be pinged
#   PlParam     "Ping"       "141.1.1.1"
