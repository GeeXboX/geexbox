PKG_LONG_DESC="OpenChrome is a project for the development of free and open-source drivers for the VIA UniChrome video chipsets. Originally called the 'snapshot' release, since it was a snapshot of an experimental branch of the unichrome cvs code, this is a continued development of the open source unichrome driver (from http://unichrome.sf.net) which also incorporates support for the unichrome-pro chipsets. Support for hardware acceleration (XvMC) for all chipsets has subsequently been ripped out of the unichrome.sf.net driver. Therefore your only option if you wish to make use of the acceleration features of your VIA chip with free and open-source drivers is to use this version of the driver."
