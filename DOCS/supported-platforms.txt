OpenBricks Supported Platforms
==============================

Supported Hardware Architectures
--------------------------------

The OpenBricks framework aims are enabling embedded Linux distribution creation
for as much hardware architectures as possible. It currently supports at least
the following ones:

* ARM:
 ** ARMv7 (Cortex-A9) with NEON extensions such as TI OMAP4.
 ** ARMv7 (Cortex-A9) such as nVidia Tegra250.
 ** ARMv7 (Cortex-A9) (with optional VFP3 extensions) such as Marvell Armada 510.
 ** ARMv7 (Cortex-A8) with NEON extensions such as TI OMAP3.
 ** ARMv6 (ARM11) (with optional VFP2 extensions) such as Broadcom BCM2708.
 ** ARMv6 (ARM11) (with optional VFP extensions) such as Broadcom BCMring.
 ** ARMv5 (ARM9) such as Marvell Kirkwood.
 ** ARMv4t (ARM9TDMI) such as Samsung S3C24xx.
* x86:
 ** 32 and 64 bits
 ** From i586 to Core-i7.
* PowerPC
* MIPS

Available Platforms
-------------------

A platform, in OpenBricks terminology, is a subset of a given hardware
architecture. It can vary from a specific SoC or microprocessor brand,
to a dedicated embedded board. Each platform may have some specific
configuration and tuning, either hardware or software but, once certified to
work with OpenBricks, it means that every owner of such a platform is ensured
that the OpenBricks project will run on it.

The OpenBricks project is continuously trying to support as much platforms as possible and donating / sponsoring is the best way to have new ones being supported. The exhaustive list of supported platforms can be found *config/platform/$arch* directory.

Certified Platforms
-------------------

While OpenBricks runs natively on all x86 computers, the ARM/PowerPC/MIPS embedded space is obviously another story.
