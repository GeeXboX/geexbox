| GEEXBOX PACKAGE STRUCTURE
| ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GeeXboX packages live under the packages/ directory in the source tree. Every
package is composed of several elements:

* meta: package metadata information file
* url: where the package sources can be downloaded from
* unpack: a script which takes care of unpacking the package sources
* build: a script which takes care of building the package from source
* install: a script to construct the runtime package
* installdev: a script to construct the devel package

| META FILE FORMAT
| ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The 'meta' file is used to provide the package metadata information (hence
the name). It is a POSIX shell script which is sourced by the build system; it
can contain variable assignments and conditional instructions.

A devel-only package (e.g. gmp, gcc-core) has three mandatory fields:

* PKG_NAME
  + the name of the package
  + must coincide with the package directory name
  + can be different from the upstream tarball name
  + will be used to create the package build directory
* PKG_VERSION
  + the upstream package current version
  + will be used to create the package build directory
* PKG_REV
  + the GeeXboX package revision
  + incremented on every major change in the package
  + reset to 1 every time PKG_VERSION changes

A devel-only package has two optional fields:

* PKG_BUILD_DEPENDS
  + the build time package dependencies, i.e. the packages required to be able
    to build the package
  + will be packaged and installed to sysroot before the package is built
  + defaults to "" (no build depends)
* PKG_DEV_DEPENDS
  + the packages required to use the dev package (e.g. gcc-core needs binutils
    to work, but requires gmp only to build)
  + will be installed to sysroot before the dev package is installed
  + defaults to "$PKG_BUILD_DEPENDS"

A runtime package has the same mandatory fields of a devel-only package, plus:

* PKG_RUN_DEPENDS
  + the runtime package dependencies, i.e. the packages required to be able
    to run the package
  + will be packaged and installed to the target system before the package is
    installed
  + defaults to "" (no runtime depends)
* PKG_PRIORITY
  + the package priority, i.e. how much the package is important
  + can be (XXX to be discussed)
    - required: the system will not boot without this package (e.g. linux)
    - standard: this package is part of the GeeXboX base system
    - optional: normal priority for packages not part of GeeXboX base system
    - extra: this is a minor non-essential package
* PKG_SECTION
  + the package category, used to group packages by function
  + can be:
    - libs
    - (XXX to be discussed/defined)
* PKG_SHORTDESC
  + used as the short description for the package
  + should be one-line summary
  + should not start with the package name
* PKG_LONGDESC
  + used as the long description for the package

A regular package has the same optional fields of a devel-only package, plus:

* PKG_DEPENDS
  + the package dependencies required both at build and at runtime
  + shorthand for adding a package to both PKG_RUN_DEPENDS and
    PKG_BUILD_DEPENDS
  + defaults to "" (no depends)
* PKG_ARCH
  + the target architectures supported by the package
  + can be:
    - any: the package is supported on all the available architectures
    - all: this is an architecture-indipendent package (e.g. enna-theme)
    - a spaced list of architecture names
  + defaults to "any"
* PKG_LICENSE
  + the upstream package license
  + can be:
    - free: the package is distributed under a DFSG-compliant license (i.e
      GPL, LGPL, MIT, etc.)
    - non-free: the package license does not meet the DFSG
  + a non-free package may restrict the distribution of the entire distro
    if it is built in, and may have unreasonable/difficult to meet restrictions
  + defaults to "free"


| META EXAMPLES

The following examples refer to r9002.

A devel-only package

PKG_NAME=gmp
PKG_VERSION=4.3.1
PKG_REV=1
PKG_BUILD_DEPENDS="ccache make"

A standard runtime package; note the use of $TARGET_LIBC in PKG_DEPENDS
to refer to the runtime system libc (which could be uClibc, glibc or eglibc)

PKG_NAME=lsof
PKG_VERSION=4.83
PKG_REV=1
PKG_DEPENDS="$TARGET_LIBC"
PKG_BUILD_DEPENDS="toolchain"
PKG_PRIORITY=optional
PKG_SECTION=utils
PKG_SHORTDESC="List open files"
PKG_LONGDESC="Lsof is a Unix-specific diagnostic tool.  Its name stands for LiSt Open Files, and it does just that.  It lists information about any files that are open, by processes currently running on the system."

A non-free package available only on selected archs

PKG_NAME=xf86-video-nvidia

PKG_PRIORITY=optional
PKG_SECTION=x11
PKG_SHORTDESC="NVIDIA binary Xorg driver"
PKG_LONGDESC="These binary drivers provide optimized hardware acceleration of OpenGL applications via a direct-rendering X Server. AGP, PCIe, SLI, TV-out and flat panel displays are also supported. This version only supports GeForce 6xxx and higher of the Geforce GPUs plus complimentary Quadros and nforce."

A complex package which shows the usage of conditionals to define the depends

PKG_NAME=MPlayer

if [ "$VDPAU" = yes ]; then
  PKG_BUILD_DEPENDS="$PKG_BUILD_DEPENDS libvdpau"
  PKG_DEPENDS="$PKG_DEPENDS libvdpau"

  PKG_BUILD_DEPENDS="$PKG_BUILD_DEPENDS SDL"
  PKG_DEPENDS="$PKG_DEPENDS SDL"

  PKG_BUILD_DEPENDS="$PKG_BUILD_DEPENDS vesautils"
  PKG_DEPENDS="$PKG_DEPENDS vesautils"
fi
PKG_PRIORITY=standard
PKG_SECTION=video
PKG_SHORTDESC="movie player for Unix-like systems"
PKG_LONGDESC="MPlayer plays most MPEG, VOB, AVI, Ogg/OGM, VIVO, ASF/WMA/WMV, QT/MOV/MP4, FLI, RM, NuppelVideo, yuv4mpeg, FILM, RoQ, PVA files, supported by many native, XAnim, RealPlayer, and Win32 DLL codecs. It can also play VideoCD, SVCD, DVD, 3ivx, RealMedia, and DivX movies. Another big feature of MPlayer is the wide range of supported output drivers. It works with X11, Xv, DGA, OpenGL, SVGAlib, fbdev, DirectFB, but also SDL (plus all its drivers) and some low level card-specific drivers (for Matrox, 3Dfx and Radeon, Mach64 and Permedia3). Most of them support software or hardware scaling, therefore allowing fullscreen display. MPlayer is also able to use some hardware MPEG decoder boards, such as the DVB and DXR3/Hollywood+."
