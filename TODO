- syslinux revision number (boot prompt) is no longer updated (depends on build date)
 + modify rootfs content in postprocess script ?

- Build debug packages
 + same as runtime pkg but with debugging symbols
 + not meant to include extra binaries for debugging purpose
 + Build all pkgs with -O2 -g flag
 + create *-dbg pkg (runtime + dev)
  * install to .install-dgb
  * use strip -o to place the stripped binaries in .install
  * use strip --only-keep-debug to make the stuff in .install-dbg debug-only

- Add external toolchain support
 + do not build gcc/binutils/glibc/... packages
 + use gcc --sysroot option to specify a new LIB_PREFIX ?

- Add some script to easily generate patches from current build tree

- Create a "geexbox-config.opk" package at builds end.
 + Must contain only configuration files for /etc
 + Must contain user custom settings
 + Generated by build script or generator
 + Must be no-arch
 + Can't be updated by opkg update, as not part of any repository
 + All packages init scripts are just expected to read their config from
   the /etc/user_defaults/* files contained within and adapt their init script
   based on that

- Add a store/repository for "opkg update/install" for releases.

- Add download mirror feature.
 + if set, all tarballs get retrieved from this location
 + useful with multiple developers on same site, with restricted WAN.

- write docs
 + how to add a new package
 + complete meta file syntax
 + what to do if one changes use flags
 + how to add a new custom platform
 + how to use distro flavors

- have generic per-platform kernel config files
 + disable (sed) features through kconfig (e.g. USB/DVB/iptables/IPv6/...)

- add a configure like entry
 + defconfig only probably won't be manageable
 + allow selecting hardware platform (if any, or generic arch)
 + allow selecting distro flavor (mini, geexbox, ...)
 + generate a default config file based on this

- allow custom busybox.conf to be declared in config/platform/$ptf
 + overload packages/busybox/config/busybox.$TARGET_ARCH.conf

- dynamic config/Kconfig.platforms generation
 + define platform specific settings in config/platform/$ptf/settings
